# Eye-Exercise
A mouse tracking web app that uses eyes to track your mouse movement.

Move the mouse around the page and notice how the eyes track your every movement. 
I added auto text uptop to go with the creepy eyes
and stylized the background so that the red of the eyes would pop out more. 


for future edits I would love to figure out how to make the eyes change color from left to right, and up and down.
