# Eye-Exercise
Created by Christopher Morel.


A mouse tracking web app that uses eyes to track your mouse movement.

This was an assignment from the Fullstack Development with MERN bootcamp via MITxPRO. This app is a reflection of my understanding and knowledge of Week 8 as exhibited by the functioning web app. 

How to run: 
Open the page and move the mouse around. Notice the eyes in the center track your mouses every movement. To reset refresh the page.
 
Road-map of future improvements:
I would like to create a reset, and stop button for this so that the user doesn't have to refresh the page to reset the app.
I added in the auto text I was thinking about so that's been accomplished.
I would like to further animate a face so that it isn't just eyes watching you.
I would love to make the eyes change color as you move from left to right and up and down.
I would love to make this in to a full on game where you have to escape the eyes.
